# NP8SAmLiTR2L - Highlighting as a tool

The strategy for retaining and connecting read texts starts with re-phrasing
paragraphes into blocks. Highlighting helps this process in two ways. It first 
[distinguishing]($P/stash/note-taking.pdf#Distinguishing the important) the information regarding their importance. This facilitates 
mental picture creation during the reading process. After making a plan
for the **deconstruction** phase, those highlights connect phrases to the original 
source and make sure that their meaning is not lost. This is possible as reading
is a [critical skill]($P/stash/note-taking.pdf#critical skill) and [can be trained]($P/stash/note-taking.pdf#don’t agree that it can’t be taught) to become more [selective with time]($P/stash/note-taking.pdf#selective with time). 

Selection process alone does not fulfill the whole purpose and would not explain
the need for [understanding]($P/stash/note-taking.pdf#requires understanding) during the creation process. Highlights act as plateaus 
to other ideas and outline structures during note taking. They [direct attention]($P/stash/note-taking.pdf#direct more attention)
and [focus]($P/stash/note-taking.pdf#focus your attention) to on certain aspects of the conveyed message.

There are two main disadvantages: (1) you can't improve highlighting as a tool.
It focuses on a section or it does not. Generating different layers of
highlighting is not effective and the process itself should be as [simple]($P/stash/note-taking.pdf#should be simple) as 
possible. (2) highlighting does not help in understanding. When [ideas are too 
complex]($P/stash/note-taking.pdf#ideas are too complex) it does not help to apply highlights to them. Without conceptional 
understanding, no classification process can happen.

In total you can say that highlighting is an important tool in the workbench for
the deconstruction of text during reading.


# fsK1BQeaGpsb - Taking systematic point of view

[Highlighting](@NP8SAmLiTR2L) is not effective as a tool when the text is too complex or poorly
organized. Instead it is much better to first take a point of view, either by
asking a question and answering that with the text, or [making headings]($P/stash/note-taking.pdf#writing headings through the text is a helpful strategy) out of
the content. Headings are more structural, inquiries are more personal to the
note system.

The shift of view forces reorganization of the content and makes connection to
more ideas possible. For example writing this paragraph is influenced by
comparison between Luhmann's note taking system and the way effective Notetaking
is described by McPherson. Asking how the more traditional strategies of note
taking can be re-phrased to Zettelkasten, conceptualizes their ideas and makes
creative working possible,

[Whether headings used in a text are of value]($P/stash/note-taking.pdf#whether headings used in a text are of value) can directly be applied to quality
of a note. Notes should seperate main points and connect themes by meaningful
links between them. They should be easily retrievable as well.

A main difference to the note taking system is association outside of the
primary source context. Classical note taking [does not need]($P/stash/note-taking.pdf#structure strategy when processing informative text) headings when the 
reader is skilled or has comprehensive knowledge of a field. The information 
can already be [encoded](@qhIvLUp9UfLq) during the reading process.

This view disregards the power of comparison between different systems. Under a
note taking system, even the expert should make new headings. This (1) encodes
the information better (2) makes comparison to the collection possible.

 - creating notes is important part
 - practicing in note system encountered difficulty when integrating into daily
     life
 - retrieving information from note system necessary for effective use
 - to practice a working kasten is required, this can only happen later

# qhIvLUp9UfLq - Story telling through writing

Encoding information plays a central role in recall. For example [structure 
and listing strategy]($P/stash/note-taking.pdf#structure strategy and listing strategy) makes the relations [more personal](/home/lorenz/Note/papers/stash/note-taking.pdf#give personal meaning to the text). Further [such signals]($P/stash/note-taking.pdf#Organizational signals like headings appear to help recall)
put the reader in the necessary context and brings up memories of other 
informations. In order to create context, [connections]($P/stash/note-taking.pdf#Recall depends heavily on how well-connected the information is.) brings together similar
ideas and makes more holistic thinking possible. Therefore the [degree of recall]($P/stash/note-taking.pdf#which the details have been integrated)
depends how well information is integrated with the rest of the material.

Traveling through notes by their connection, makes story telling possible. For
example the traditional notetaking can be interpreted under the premise of
connected notes. First the material is grouped into separate notes and
connections are established. An additional, only half related idea (here the
note system) is used to interpret those connections. Finally the upcoming
thoughts by comparison are put into notes and connected to the existing system.

This practice is similar to [taking a point of view](@fsK1BQeaGpsb) after material is already 
integrated into the system. Further it may be used for language learning as
well.

# astDlfe3W9ja - Making notes your own

Putting yourself into a conversation [with other persons](/home/lorenz/Note/papers/stash/note-taking.pdf#you are telling a friend what it’s about), makes interpretations
detached from the actual content. The reaction of a person is a most human thing
to practice and it comes natural to view the information from a conversation
point of view. This embroiders explanation and makes clear that the message is
[clearly understood](/home/lorenz/Note/papers/stash/note-taking.pdf#if you can’t put it into words, it doesn’t count) and can be varied on.

A seldom intuitive skill is abstracting from the writting source to a concise,
personal piece of information. Grouping related concepts into a single word can
[make the intention](/home/lorenz/Note/papers/stash/note-taking.pdf#list of items into a categorical grouping) of the text clearer. Re-ordering notes [different](/home/lorenz/Note/papers/stash/note-taking.pdf#rigidly following a paint-by-numbers approach) from the
original text makes structure simpler.

When references are made, integration into the Zettelkasten becomes much easier.
Re-expressing the content [makes it agnostic](/home/lorenz/Note/papers/stash/note-taking.pdf#best summaries are made without reference) to the original references. Composing
ideas is [far easier](/home/lorenz/Note/papers/stash/note-taking.pdf#far easier to use your own words) when you use your own words.

# 5yb29CiXodOS - Practicing good note taking
 
 [A good summary](/home/lorenz/Note/papers/stash/note-taking.pdf#A good summary) is concise and expressed with personal connections. When taking
 to note taking, the connectiveness is important as well.

 A question is what specific parts can be practices and drilled for better note
 taking.
