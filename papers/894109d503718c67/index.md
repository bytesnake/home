The chapter on [Fourier Series]($P/894109d503718c6u7/index.pdf) starts with a short historical summary ofthe 
origin and invention of fourier series.

In the [Warmup Section]($P/894109d503718c67/index.pdf#A real- or complex-valued) the periodicity condition of functions, the trigonometric 
and exponential series and the relation to Fourier series are introduced.
Further examples series developments for simple odd-even rectangular and 
triangular functions are derived in examples.

Exercises of [1. exponential forms]($P/894109d503718c67/index.pdf#1. EXPONENTIAL) were simple with substiution for (a) and 
linear argument for (b). For [2. amplitude-phase formulation]($P/894109d503718c67/index.pdf#2. AMPLITUDE-PHASE) application of 
`sin(a+b)` trigonometric law, gives the desired result. With the remark on
[2p period]($P/894109d503718c67/index.pdf#Remark PERIOD 2p INSTEAD) it is obvious that the Fourier series for `f(ct)` is the same for 
`p=c\pi` when [changing scale]($P/894109d503718c67/index.pdf#SCALE CHANGE). From the periodic property of the Fourier series 
it follows for [time shift]($P/894109d503718c67/index.pdf#TIME SHIFT) same coefficients `a_n`, `b_n` with different series 
development in argument. The remark on [linearity]($P/894109d503718c67/index.pdf#REMARK LINEARITY OF FOURIER) of fourier operators makes the
scaled and shifted odd square wave [exercise 4.4]($P/894109d503718c67/index.pdf#Fourier series of f) simple. For the next exercise, 
we simply need to [apply series development]($P/894109d503718c67/index.pdf#FOURIER SERIES AND COEFFICIENTS) of section to find the results for 
[functions]($P/894109d503718c67/index.pdf#Find the Fourier series of the). Exponentials Fourier series in [exercise 6.]($P/894109d503718c67/index.pdf#Find the exponential Fourier) are derived with the
the [Fourier series]($P/894109d503718c67/index.pdf#FOURIER SERIES AND COEFFICIENTS). For (a) we can simply use the periodicity of integral. 
Both are terms of `integrate xe^x`. The [derivative]($P/894109d503718c67/index.pdf#is differentiable, must the derivative) of a periodic function is 
periodic. The [integral]($P/894109d503718c67/index.pdf#is integrable over all closed intervals) only if the function is odd in period (see condition).

For coefficients `1/sqrt(n)` [there is not function]($P/894109d503718c67/index.pdf#Does there exist an) as the energy is not bounded. 
For coefficients `1/n` a Log function clamps between 0/2pi boundaries, as can be
seen in this [Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3310746/fourier-series-with-all-coefficients-frac1n).

For Parseval theorem of [function products]($P/894109d503718c67/index.pdf#13. PRODUCTS Let) substituting the complex definition 
with [trigonometric coefficients]($P/894109d503718c67/index.pdf#of the trigonometric series into exponential form) yields the required identity. The sine 
[orthonormal basis]($P/894109d503718c67/index.pdf#14. Show that) exercise can be solved by using sine law, integrating over
cosine terms and recognizing the resulting sinc function.
