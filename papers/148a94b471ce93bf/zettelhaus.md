## Header for mastodon instance

This instance specializes on linked toots. We make them publicly and
collaboratively accessible.

The principle is baed on hashtags and replies. Single-single and many-many
linking differs only in using identifiers and human readable tags. Linearization
of connections are using replies, where parent-child relation signifies their
connection.

For literature notes you can use the CodiMd instance at pad.zettel.haus. Those
notes are also permanently stored and can be linked in the same way.

### Rules

(1) every note should be references by or reference another note with hashtags
(2) the content of a note should be self-contained, compare between or
synthesize other notes
(3) any language is welcome, expect those of hate and bigotry
(4) an account needs to have a minimum diameter of five after the first two
months
